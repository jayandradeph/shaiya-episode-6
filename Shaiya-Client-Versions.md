# [- Build Version 0x13120600 (Shaiya PT)]

### [Game.exe with Costumes, Pets, and Ep5 Interfaces:]
It seems that this version of Shaiya includes features such as costumes and pets, which might not have been present in the original version of Episode 5.

### [Ep6.3 Build for Ep5:]
This indicates that the game is built on the Episode 6.3 framework but retains the look and feel of Episode 5. This could include gameplay mechanics, itemization, or other elements that were present in Episode 5.

### [No Auction House Implemented:]
Unlike later episodes or lower versions of Shaiya, it appears that there is no Auction House system in this custom version. Players might rely on different methods for trading and selling items.

### [Mounts System:]
The Mounts System in this Game.exe lacks the last two fields found in structures like 0x16012100 and 0x16021200 from Episode 6.4. Consequently, implementing new mounts in this version presents a challenge similar to the standard Episode 5 version, as these specific fields do not exist in the Game.exe.
