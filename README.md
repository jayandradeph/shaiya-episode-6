## Goal

To build a stable library that replaces pet.dll and exceeds its capabilities.

## Motivation

I worked at two private servers that used the [pet](https://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/shaiya-pserver-guides-releases/4102262-release-shen1ls-wings.html) library. I learned a lot, but building code alongside another library can be frustrating. It took at least two years to become comfortable with the situation.
